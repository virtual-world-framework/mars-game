# The trigger factory creates triggers from yaml declarations.

properties:
  # Any triggers placed here will be automatically loaded when loadTriggers
  #   is called.
  # A trigger consists of two pieces:
  #   triggerCondition: When this condition becomes true, the trigger may fire
  #   actions: Each of these will be run, in order, when the trigger fires
  triggers:

  # This holds our triggers.  For internal use only.
  triggersSet$: undefined

methods:
  # This function loops through our triggers property and creates all the 
  #   triggers, including setting up callbacks to make them fire.  From 
  #   there on out, the magic should just happen.
  # arguments: context
  loadTriggers:

  # This function takes a trigger list (like our triggers property) and loads
  #   the contents.
  # arguments: triggerList, context
  loadTriggerList:

  # Adds a single trigger.
  # arguments: triggerName, trigger, context
  addTrigger:

  # This function clears out all of our triggers so that they will stop firing.
  #   You can still call loadTriggers again if you want to recreate them.
  clearTriggers:

  # This function clears out only triggers that appear in the specified list.
  # NOTE: we do matching based solely on the keys - we don't check if the 
  #   trigger is actually the same.
  # arguments: triggerList
  clearTriggerList:

  # Checks whether we have any triggers
