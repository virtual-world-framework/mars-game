# The prototype for objects that are generated by a generator.

--- 
extends: http://vwf.example.com/node.vwf

methods:
  # Every generated object must define this function - this is where the actual
  #   generation is done.  
  # Arguments: 
  #   params      - the list of parameter values from the data specification
  #   generator   - the generator that created us (in case you need to generate
  #                 child objects or something)
  #   payload     - Some instances of generators use this, others may not.  
  #                 Allows you to pass any additional data you need along
  #                 to the generated object (for example, some trigger
  #                 clauses need access to the trigger itself).
  # Returns: true if the data is valid and the object can be used, false 
  #   otherwise.
  onGenerated:

  # A helper function for extracting an array of strings from one of the
  #   parameters. If the parameter is a string, it creates an array with just
  #   that string.  If the parameter is an array, it returns it.  If the param
  #   is undefined it returns an empty array.
  # Arguments:
  #   param       - the parameter to load
  # Returns: the array
