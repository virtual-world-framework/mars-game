# The prototype for objects that are generated by a generator.

--- 
extends: http://vwf.example.com/node.vwf

implements: 
  - http://vwf.example.com/sceneGetter.vwf

methods:
  # Every generated object must define this function - this is where the actual
  #   generation is done.  
  # Arguments: 
  #   params      - the list of parameter values from the data specification
  #   generator   - the generator that created us (in case you need to generate
  #                 child objects or something)
  #   payload     - Some instances of generators use this, others may not.  
  #                 Allows you to pass any additional data you need along
  #                 to the generated object (for example, some trigger
  #                 clauses need access to the trigger itself).
  # Returns: true if the data is valid and the object can be used, false 
  #   otherwise.
  onGenerated:

  # A helper that does basically what Find does, except that it handles some of
  #   the busywork (and assumes that we'll be looking in the scene).
  # Arguments: 
  #   objectName  - the string to search for
  findInScene:

  # Same as findInScene, except that this looks by type rather than by name.
  # Arguments: 
  #   typeName    - the type to search for
  findTypeInScene:
