# The boolean function factory creates boolean function from yaml declarations.
# It also sets up the callbacks necessary to know when the boolean function 
# needs to be reevaluated. This is used to create the checks for triggers.
#
# A boolean function contains a single "clause," which is something we want to
# check (for example, an isAtPosition clause, or a hasObject clause).  The 
# clause can be an and, or, or not clause, and these clauses contain sub-
# clauses.
#
# This all leans on the declarative function executor, which treats the clauses
# as declarative functions that set up the necessary callbacks and return the
# function that performs the actual check.

methods:
  # This function should be called by every clause from inside of onGenerated.
  #   It handles shared parts of the initialization.  Arguments are the same as
  #   onGenerated.
  initClause:

  # This is the function that actually gets called to check whether this
  #   clause is true or false.
