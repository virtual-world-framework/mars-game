# A generated object prototype for clauses.

extends: source/triggers/generators/generatedObject.vwf

properties:
  # The trigger that this clause belongs to.
  parentTrigger:

methods:
  # This is the function that actually gets called to check whether this
  #   clause is true or false. Must be implemented by the child clause.
  evaluateClause: 

  # This function should be called by every clause from inside of onGenerated.  
  #   It handles shared parts of the initialization.  Arguments are the same as 
  #   onGenerated.
  initClause:

  # This is the function that actually gets called to check whether this
  #   clause is true or false. Must be implemented by the child clause.
  evaluateClause: 

  # These get called when the trigger is enabled/disabled. Not implemented 
  #   here, but children can implement it.
  onEnabled:
  onDisabled:

  # This gets called when the trigger is successfully evaluated by its trigger 
  #   group (if any) - that is, when it could was ready to fire, whether or not
  #   it was actually triggered.
  onEvaluated:

  # This gets called when the trigger fires.  As with the above methods, it's 
  #   not implemented here.
  onTriggered:
