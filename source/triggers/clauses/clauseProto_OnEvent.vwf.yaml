# A generated object for OnEvent clauses (i.e. clauses that are true when some
#   event has just occurred).  Automatically handles tracking how long since 
#   the event occurred, and can be customized as to how recent the event needs
#   to have been.

extends: clauseProto.vwf

properties:
  # how recent does the event have to have been?
  # NOTE: if the trigger is in a trigger group, it could be as much as
  #   0.12 seconds (two trigger group updates) before the trigger group is 
  #   ready to fire (plus any frame delay).  I wouldn't set this to less 
  #   than 0.5 seconds to be safe (especially given that some machines have
  #   better performance than others).
  threshold$:

  # when did the event last happen?
  lastEventTime$:

methods:
  # This function should be called by every child from inside of onGenerated.
  #   It handles shared parts of the initialization.  Arguments are the same as
  #   onGenerated, plus the value for threshold$ (since I don't know which 
  #   parameter it will be).
  # NOTE: I call initClause, so you don't have to.
  initOnEvent:

  # call this when the event occurs, and the magic will happen.
  onEvent:

  # call when you want to reset the last event time
