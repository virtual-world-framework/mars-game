        Path plotted! 
        <br><br>You can use the slope of the line (which is also called the 
        'rate of change') to help you build a program that moves
        along the line. Slope is rise over run, or the amount to move along
        the Y axis over the amount to move along the X axis.  Your slope is
        2, or 2/1, so if you move two spaces forward (up the Y axis) and then 1 
        space to the right (along the X axis) then you should end up back on top
        of the Mini Rover's tracks.
        <br><br>Switching to Helicam view can make it easier to tell which way
        is X and which way is Y.
