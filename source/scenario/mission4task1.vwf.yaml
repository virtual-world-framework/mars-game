      content: >
        Congratulations! You've found the Base Pod! 
        <br><br>The pod you've found contains a large supply of Nanites! 
        Nanites are microscopic robots that can construct base components using 
        nothing but the air and soil of Mars. The pod also contains your 
        newest rover, Peregrine, who is designed to transport the Nanites 
        and place them on the ground to build the base for the humans. 
        <br><br>You seem to be running low on battery! Let's get Peregrine 
        working on building some solar panels. Your Helicam will illuminate 
        a triangle on the ground where you can build a solar panel. All you 
        have to do is match the target triangle in Peregrine's program.
        <br><br>The first triangle has vertices at (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0).
        These are the same as the vertices built into the Draw Triangle block,
        so just drag that block over and hit START.
