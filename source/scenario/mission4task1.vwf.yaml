      content: >
        Congratulations! You’ve found the cargo pod! 
        <br><br>The pod you've found contains a large amount of nanites! 
        Nanites are microscopic robots that can construct materials using 
        nothing but the air and soil of Mars. The pod also contained your 
        newest rover, Peregrine, who is designed to transport the nanites 
        and place them on the ground to build the base for the humans. 
        <br><br>You seem to be running low on battery! Let's get Peregrine 
        working on building some solar panels. Your helicam will illuminate 
        a triangle on the ground where you can build a solar panel. All you 
        have to do is put in the vertices of the triangle for Peregrine to 
        follow and his built-in program will do the rest. <br><br>Remember, 
        a vertex is an ordered pair of coordinates: ( x, y ). Set the x and 
        y values in the program to match the ordered pairs in your objective 
        indicator.
