        Congratulations! You’ve found the Base Pod! 
        <br><br>The pod you've found contains a large supply of nanites! 
        Nanites are microscopic robots that can construct base components using 
        nothing but the air and soil of Mars. The pod also contains your 
        newest rover, Peregrine, who is designed to transport the nanites 
        and place them on the ground to build the base for the humans. 
        <br><br>You seem to be running low on battery! Let's get Peregrine 
        working on building some solar panels. Your helicam will illuminate 
        a triangle on the ground where you can build a solar panel. All you 
        have to do is to specify the vertices of the triangle for Peregrine to 
        follow and his DrawTriangle procedure will do the rest. 
        <br><br>Remember, a vertex is an ordered pair of coordinates: ( x, y ). 
        Adjust the x and y values in the program to match the corners of the 
        triangle you want to draw.
