        Oh no, your mini rover has gone off!
        <br><br>Luckily, you've also learned the location of the base pod,
        which contains materials essential to your mission. Your navigate
        procedure appears to be damaged, you'll need to reconstruct it 
        step-by-step in order to be able to travel somewhere just by knowing
        its coordinates.
        <br><br>In order to use procedures you'll need two things: the procedure 
        definition and the procedure call. The procedure definition is the sequence 
        of blocks starting with a purple block containing a gear in the top left. 
        It defines the sequence of actions that the procedure block will do. On top
        of defining the procedure's steps, you can also define the name and variables
        that the procedure uses.
        <br><br>The procedure call happens when you use a procedure block with appropriate
        inputs for the variables. Once a procedure definition is created, a procedure
        block can be obtained by going into the "Procedures" tab in the toolbox, or by
        right clicking the procedure definition and choosing "Create [procedure name]".
        When a procedure block is used it will execute all of the steps defined in the
        procedure definition through the use of a single block! Isn't that handy?
        <br><br>Mission Control has downloaded a simple procedure definition for you
        which moves you forward if your destination location is further in the negative-Y
        direction than your current position. She has also provided a test program 
        through a procedure call, which attempts to navigate three spots down in the Y-direction. 
        Start the program and see if it works!
