        Welcome to The Mars Game!  
        <br><br>You are a rover, sent on a mission to Mars... but it 
        appears that you've crashed and you can't quite remember what it is 
        that you're here for! 
        <br><br>Your first task is to relearn your control interface and to
        gather up nearby equipment.
