        Well done!  
        <br><br>Next, it's time to recover your radio and make contact with 
        Mission Control! Of course, getting there through all of this debris may 
        require a bit of care...
        <br><br>As you work, you may want to switch to Helicam view and use
        the arrow keys or right mouse button to look around. The mouse wheel 
        will let you zoom in and out. You can also use the TILES display to 
        count spaces and see where you can and can't move. Finally, if you  
        want to start over you can hit the RESET button (next to the START 
        button) to clear your program and re-start the task.
