        Well done! You have successfully placed the nanites! 
        <br><br>Unfortunately, the spot where we had you place the nanites is too 
        close to the cliff, so it will be in the shade for much of the day. <br><br>
        Let's translate the vertices of the last triangle to move them further from 
        the cliff wall. To translate, or move the triangle, you need to add or 
        subtract from the x and y values of the vertices. Try translating the 
        triangle 10 spaces along the positive x axis. <br><br>Remember, the x axis 
        goes from the left (negative x) to the right (positive x). So you will have to 
        add to the x values of your triangle vertices in order to move them along the 
        positive x axis. Try adding 10 to the x values of your triangle's vertices. The 
        addition operation block may come in handy!
