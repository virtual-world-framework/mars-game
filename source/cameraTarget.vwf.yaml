# A component that extends or implements this component can be set as a
# target for the game camera. A camera component has at least one camera
# mount and can have multiple. When the camera is targeting this target,
# a mount name can be passed to the setCameraMount method of the game
# camera and it will search the target for a mount of that name and set
# the camera mount to it.
