You are a new kind of self-learning rover that we sent to Mars to prepare a Base for the Human Explorers, who are nearing Mars orbit. A comet fragment hit your ship during reentry and all your equipment has been scattered over the planet’s surface. That’s problem number one. Problem number two: we have lost contact with the humans. The good news is you can restore contact with them from your end with the help of your Mini Rover. Which brings us to problem number three: your Mini Rover has wandered off and we need you to find it. To do so you will need to plot a course to match the track it left behind.
