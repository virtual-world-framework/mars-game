Anyhoo, something went wrong during your atmosphere entry procedure and your vehicle and all your mission equipment have been scattered over a significant fraction of the planet’s surface. So that’s problem number one. Problem number two: we have lost contact with the humans. The good news is you can restore contact with them from your end. The bad news is there is third problem: You are missing 99.9% of your brain."
